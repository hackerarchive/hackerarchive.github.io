    <h1>HackerArchive – One Long Text to Learn C++</h1>

    <p>
      This page is a single, long-form text designed to teach you the C++ programming
      language from absolute basics to more advanced concepts. Read it linearly,
      like a book. C++ is a low-level, fast, and powerful language used in operating
      systems, game engines, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What is C++</h2>
    <p>
      C++ is a compiled language, which means the source code must be processed
      by a compiler (such as GCC, Clang, or MSVC) into machine code. C++ programs
      are extremely fast, but they require the programmer to manage memory carefully.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Your First Program</h2>
    <p>The classic <code>Hello World</code> program looks like this:</p>
    <pre>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      The <code>main</code> function is the entry point of the program. The
      <code>#include</code> directive imports a library, and <code>std::cout</code>
      is used to print text to the console.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Variables and Data Types</h2>
    <p>
      C++ is a statically typed language, meaning every variable has a specific type:
    </p>
    <pre>
int a = 10;
double b = 3.14;
char c = 'A';
bool isTrue = true;
    </pre>

    <p>
      Common primitive types include <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>,
      <code>double</code>, <code>char</code>, and <code>bool</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Conditional Statements</h2>
    <p>
      Conditions allow your program to make decisions:
    </p>
    <pre>
if (a > 5) {
    std::cout << "a is greater than 5";
} else {
    std::cout << "a is less than or equal to 5";
}
    </pre>

    <h2>5. Loops</h2>
    <p>
      Loops are used to repeat code execution:
    </p>
    <pre>
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
}

while (a > 0) {
    a--;
}
    </pre>

    <h2>6. Functions</h2>
    <p>
      Functions allow you to split your program into reusable blocks:
    </p>
    <pre>
int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
    </pre>

    <h2>7. Pointers and Memory</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important (and difficult) parts of C++ is understanding
      pointers. A pointer stores a memory address:
    </p>
    <pre>
int x = 5;
int* ptr = &x;
    </pre>

    <p>
      Incorrect memory usage can lead to crashes and vulnerabilities, which is
      why C++ requires discipline and precision.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
    <p>
      C++ supports classes and objects:
    </p>
    <pre>
class Person {
public:
    std::string name;
    int age;

    void sayHello() {
        std::cout << "Hi, my name is " << name;
    }
};
    </pre>

    <h2>9. The Standard Library</h2>
    <p>
      The STL (Standard Template Library) provides containers such as
      <code>vector</code> and <code>map</code>, along with algorithms and utilities
      that make development faster and safer.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Final Words</h2>
    <p>
      C++ is a difficult language, but also one of the most powerful. Learning it
      takes time, practice, and a deep understanding of how computers work under
      the hood. If you master C++, many other languages will become easier to learn.
